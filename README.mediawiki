AntiORM is the ORM that goes against all

While others ORM isolate the database creating internally SQL queries and DB tables from a class specification, AntiORM create for you a Python function parsing the SQL code, allowing to do more optimized or specialized hand-made queries. It's said: it works exactly the other way ORMs do.

Developed originally as part of the [https://github.com/piranna/PirannaFS PirannaFS] filesystem project and focused in SQLite, it have been modified to be for general purpose and usable with any other DB engine.
